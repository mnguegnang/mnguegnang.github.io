Instability in national grid power generation has compelled industries, particularly telecommunications, to rely on plant generators for business operations. These secondary generators present challenges such as fuel leakages and inaccurate fuel level gauges. Consequently, telecommunication operators experience a persistent demand for fuel to supply diesel generators. Increasing fuel prices, driven by global economic pressures and policy changes including carbon pricing, have exacerbated issues of excessive fuel consumption and pilferage.

These challenges disrupt network operations and impose substantial financial burdens. The need for predictive monitoring is heightened by these market pressures. In this study, four machine learning algorithms Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Lasso were trained and compared to predict fuel consumption in power generation plants. The Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest predictive accuracy, with a Nash efficiency value of 99.1%. By contextualizing the problem within current economic conditions, this research underscores its significance for decision-makers addressing these complexities.
