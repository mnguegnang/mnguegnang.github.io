## **Applied Mathematics Consultant for AI Model Training**
**Outlier AI & Mercor** | *Remote, Germany*
*Oct 2025 - Present*

**Post Training Strategies:** Stress-test advanced models to identify reasoning and agentic failures, and apply mathematical logic in prompt engineering to address performance gaps in specialized STEM domains. I focus on three principal methods: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and rubric-based evaluation.
**Key Technical Achievements:**
*   **Advanced Alignment Strategy (RLHF & RLVR):**
    *   Used RLHF and RLVR to align model behavior for specialized real-world tasks.
    *   Identified logic and agent trajectory failures to design rigorous training frameworks.
*   **Reasoning Enhancement via Chain-of-Thought:**
    *   Developed research-oriented prompts using **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** frameworks.
    *   Transformed abstract mathematical concepts into reliable ground-truth data, significantly improving model reasoning in advanced STEM tasks.
*   **Agentic AI & Error Analysis:**
    *   Analyzed agent trajectories to assess alignment with user requests.
    *   Evaluated function calling precision, such as detecting “Trigger Phrases,” and classified execution results to diagnose failures in multi-step reasoning.
*   **Evaluation & Peer Review:**
    *   Created detailed rubrics and reviewed peer contributions to ensure prompt engineering strategies met industry standards.
**Tech Stack:** Python, RLHF, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Agentic Workflows.
